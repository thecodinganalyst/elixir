# Elixir

Elixir is a frontend creator to allow automatic creation of the web layer with just json files. It follows the material design system, and is built with Angular.

Instead of creating a different set of files for each implementation of new features or pages, elixir allows developers to reuse the same codebase, with a configuration file for each page, stating both the design and data. 
The configuration file will be retrieved dynamically via http, so the design can be generated dynamically when needed, to achieve very low coupling and atomicity for the web layer. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.3.

## Status

1. Able to create navigation and table dynamically

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
