# Elixir

Elixir is a frontend web application builder, that allows users to create the user interface for their web applications easily with json data files. It is built with [Angular](https://angular.io/), implementing the [Material design system](https://material.io/) with [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).

This project is still work-in-progress, and many features have not been implemented. But it is actively in development. 

Build instructions are available at [build](./build.md)

# Usage

Currently, only the following features are available:

1. Display a [sidenav](https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/overview) for navigation
2. Display [table](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview) view
3. Display form, of which only textbox, dropdown, and buttons are available
